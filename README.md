### 2. Nearby Amenities
   Endpoint:
  GET /api/property/:id/nearby-amenities



Design Decisions & Trade-offs
Node.js + Express: Chosen for rapid API development and scalability.

MongoDB: Flexible schema for property data.

Google Places API: Reliable external data source for nearby amenities.

Trade-off: External API calls may increase latency. Caching strategies are needed for speed.

Error Handling: Implemented basic try-catch with descriptive error messages.

Security: API keys stored in .env file (not committed to repo).



 Future Improvements
Redis Caching: Cache search results and amenities data to reduce API call latency.

Pagination: For large property datasets.

Rate Limiting: To prevent abuse of API endpoints.

Unit Tests: Using Jest or Mocha for robust testing.

Dockerization: To containerize the application for easier deployment.
